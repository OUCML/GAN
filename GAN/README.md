This is a repository for sharing the usable GAN models that have been run by members of ML Group of OUC. Those models are from classic works, which have already been published.
The subfiles named as the names of the students need to be organized and managemented by students respectively.
Each student can upload the code of the paper releated to GAN which he or she presented in the Reading Group.
